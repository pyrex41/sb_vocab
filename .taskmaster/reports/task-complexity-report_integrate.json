			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for each activity script file (e.g., multiple_choice_activity.gd, synonym_antonym_activity.gd, etc.) to add signal connections and input disabling logic.",
			"reasoning": "Affects multiple activity scripts, requiring consistent changes across files, with testing for input disabling during loading periods, increasing complexity due to breadth."
